\arguments{
\item{ftime}{A numeric vector of failure times. Right-censored observations
should have corresponding \code{ftype} set to 0.}

\item{ftype}{A numeric vector indicating the type of failure. Observations
with \code{ftype == 0} are treated as right-censored. Each unique value
besides zero is treated as a separate type of failure.}

\item{trt}{A numeric vector indicating observed treatment assignment. Each
unique value will be treated as an (unordered) separate type of treatment.
Currently, only two unique values of \code{trt} are supported.}

\item{adjustVars}{A \code{data.frame} of adjustment variables that will be
used in estimating the conditional treatment, censoring, and failure
(hazard or conditional mean) probabilities.}

\item{t0}{The time at which to return cumulative incidence estimates. By
default this is set to \code{max(ftime)}.}

\item{SL.ftime}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} argument in the call to \code{SuperLearner} for the
outcome regression (either cause-specific hazards or conditional mean). See
the documentation of \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} for more
information on how to specify valid \code{SuperLearner} libraries. It is
expected that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the
input variables, which will be called \code{"trt"} and
\code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{SL.ctime}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to
\code{SL.library} in the call to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
for the estimate of the conditional hazard for censoring. It is expected
that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the input
variables, which will be called \code{"trt"} and \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{SL.trt}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to
\code{SL.library} in the call to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
for the estimate of the conditional probability of treatment. It is
expected that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the
input variables, which will be \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ftime}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the outcome regression (either cause-specific
hazards or conditional mean). Ignored if \code{SL.ftime != NULL}. Use
\code{"trt"} to specify the treatment in this formula (see examples). The
formula can additionally include any variables found in
\code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ctime}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the estimate of the conditional hazard for
censoring. Ignored if \code{SL.ctime != NULL}. Use \code{"trt"} to specify
the treatment in this formula (see examples). The formula can additionally
include any variables found in \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.trt}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the estimate of the conditional probability of
treatment. Ignored if \code{SL.trt != NULL}. By default set to "1",
corresponding to using empirical estimates of each value of \code{trt}. The
formula can include any variables found in \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{att}{A \code{boolean} indicating whether to compute the ATT estimate,
instead of treatment specific survival curves. This option only works with 
two levels of \code{trt} that are labeled with 0 and 1.}

\item{returnIC}{A \code{logical} indicating whether to return vectors of
influence curve estimates. These are needed for some post-hoc comparisons,
so it is recommended to leave as \code{TRUE} (the default) unless the user
is sure these estimates will not be needed later.}

\item{returnModels}{A \code{logical} indicating whether to return the
\code{glm} or \code{SuperLearner} objects used to estimate the nuisance
parameters. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if the user plans to use
\code{\link{timepoints}} to obtain estimates at times other than \code{t0}.
See the documentation of \code{\link{timepoints}} for more information.}

\item{ftypeOfInterest}{An input specifying what failure types to compute
estimates of incidence for. The default value computes estimates for values
\code{unique(ftype)}. Can alternatively be set to a vector of values found
in \code{ftype}.}

\item{trtOfInterest}{An input specifying which levels of \code{trt} are of
interest. The default value computes estimates for all of the values in
\code{unique(trt)}. Can alternatively be set to a vector of values
found in \code{trt}.}

\item{method}{A character specification of how the targeted minimum
loss-based estimators should be computer, either \code{"mean"} or
\code{"hazard"}. The \code{"mean"} specification uses a closed-form
targeted minimum loss-based estimation based on the G-computation formula
of Bang and Robins (2005). The \code{"hazard"} specification uses an
iterative algorithm based on cause-specific hazard functions. The latter
specification has no guarantee of convergence in finite samples. The
convergence can be influenced by the stopping criteria specified in the
\code{tol}. Future versions may implement a closed form version of this
hazard-based estimator.}

\item{bounds}{A list of bounds.}

\item{verbose}{A \code{logical} indicating whether the function should print
messages to indicate progress.}

\item{tol}{The stopping criteria when \code{method = "hazard"}. The
algorithm will continue performing targeting updates to the initial
estimators until the empirical mean of the efficient influence function is
smaller than \code{tol}. The default (\code{1/length(ftime)}) is a sensible
value. Larger values can be used in situations where convergence of the
algorithm is an issue; however, this may lead to large finite-sample bias.}

\item{maxIter}{A maximum number of iterations for the algorithm when
\code{method = "hazard"}. The algorithm will iterate until either the
empirical mean of the efficient influence function is smaller than
\code{tol} or until \code{maxIter} iterations have been completed.}

\item{Gcomp}{A \code{logical} indicating whether to compute the
G-computation estimator (i.e., a substitution estimator with no targeting
step). Note: theory does not support inference for the G-computation
estimator if Super Learner is used to estimate failure and censoring
mechanisms. Only implemented for \code{method = "mean"}.}
