\arguments{
\item{ftime}{A numeric vector of failure times. Right-censored observations
should have corresponding \code{ftype} set to 0.}

\item{ftype}{A numeric vector indicating the type of failure. Observations
with \code{ftype=0} are treated as having been right-censored. Each unique
value besides zero is treated as a separate type of failure.}

\item{trt}{A numeric vector indicating observed treatment assignment. Each
unique value will be treated as a different type of treatment. Currently,
only two unique values are supported.}

\item{t0}{The time at which to return cumulative incidence estimates. By
default this is set to \code{max(ftime[ftype > 0])}.}

\item{adjustVars}{A data.frame of adjustment variables that will be used in
estimating the conditional treatment, censoring, and failure (hazard or
conditional mean) probabilities.}

\item{SL.ftime}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} option of \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} for
the cause-specific hazards. See the documentation of
\code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} for more information on how to
specify valid \code{SuperLearner} libraries. It is expected that the
wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the input variables,
which will be called \code{"trt"}, \code{names(adjustVars)}, and \code{"t"}
if \code{method = "hazard"}.}

\item{SL.ctime}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} option of \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} for
the estimate of the conditional hazard for censoring. It is expected that
the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the input variables,
which will be called \code{"trt"} and \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{SL.trt}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} option of \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} for
the estimate of the conditional probability of treatment. It is expected
that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the input
variables, which will be \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ftime}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the outcome regression. Ignored if
\code{SL.ftime} is not equal to \code{NULL}. Use \code{"trt"} to specify
the treatment in this formula (see examples). The formula can additionally
include any variables found in \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ctime}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the estimate of the conditional hazard for
censoring. Ignored if \code{SL.ctime} is not equal to \code{NULL}. Use
\code{"trt"} to specify the treatment in this formula (see examples). The
formula can additionally include any variables found in
\code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.trt}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the estimate of the conditional probability of
treatment. Ignored if \code{SL.trt} is not equal to \code{NULL}. The
formula can include any variables found in \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.family}{The type of regression to be performed if fitting GLMs in
the estimation and fluctuation procedures. The default is "binomial" for
logistic regression. Only change this from the default if there are
justifications that are well understood. This is passed directly to
\code{\link{estimateCensoring}} and \code{\link{estimateHazards}}.}

\item{att}{A \code{boolean} indicating whether to compute the ATT estimate,
instead of treatment specific survival curves. This option only works with 
two levels of \code{trt} that are labeled with 0 and 1.}

\item{returnIC}{A \code{logical} indicating whether to return vectors of
influence curve estimates. These are needed for some post-hoc comparisons,
so it is recommended to leave as \code{TRUE} (the default) unless the user
is sure these estimates will not be needed later.}

\item{returnModels}{A \code{logical} indicating whether to return the
\code{glm} or \code{SuperLearner} objects used to estimate the nuisance
parameters. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if the user plans to use
\code{\link{timepoints}} to obtain estimates of incidence at times other
than \code{t0}. See the documentation of \code{\link{timepoints}} for more
information.}

\item{ftypeOfInterest}{An input specifying what failure types to compute
estimates of incidence for. The default value computes estimates for values
\code{unique(ftype)}. Can alternatively be set to a vector of values found
in \code{ftype}.}

\item{trtOfInterest}{An input specifying which levels of \code{trt} are of
interest. The default value computes estimates for all values in
\code{unique(trt)}. Can alternatively be set to a vector of values found in
\code{trt}.}

\item{cvControl}{A \code{list} providing control options to be fed directly
into calls to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}. This should match
the contents of \code{SuperLearner.CV.control} exactly. For details,
consult the documentation of the \pkg{SuperLearner} package. This is
usually passed in through the \code{\link{survtmle}} wrapper function.}

\item{bounds}{A \code{data.frame} of bounds on the conditional hazard
function. The \code{data.frame} should have a column named \code{"t"} that
includes values \code{seq_len(t0)}. The other columns should be names
\code{paste0("l",j)} and \code{paste0("u",j)} for each unique failure type
label j, denoting lower and upper bounds, respectively. See examples.}

\item{verbose}{A \code{logical} indicating whether the function should print
messages to indicate progress. If \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
is called internally, this option will additionally be passed to
\code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}.}

\item{tol}{The stopping criteria. The TMLE algorithm performs updates to the
initial estimators until the empirical mean of the efficient influence
function is smaller than \code{tol} or until \code{maxIter} iterations have
been completed. The default (\code{1 / length(ftime)}) is a sensible value.
Larger values can be used in situations where convergence of the algorithm
is an issue; however, this may result in large finite-sample bias.}

\item{maxIter}{The maximum number of iterations for the algorithm. The
algorithm will iterate until either the empirical mean of the efficient
influence function is smaller than \code{tol} or until \code{maxIter}
iterations have been completed.}

\item{gtol}{The truncation level of predicted censoring survival. Setting to
larger values can help performance in data sets with practical positivity
violations.}

\item{stratify}{If \code{TRUE}, then the hazard model is estimated using only
the observations with \code{trt == trtOfInterest}. Only works if 
\code{length(trtOfInterest) == 1}. If \code{stratify = TRUE} then \code{glm.ftime}
cannot include \code{trt} in the model formula and any learners in \code{SL.ftime}
should not assume a variable named \code{trt} will be included in the candidate 
super learner estimators.}

\item{...}{Other options. Not currently used.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{survtmle}.
\describe{
  \item{call}{The call to \code{survtmle}.}
  \item{est}{A numeric vector of point estimates -- one for each combination
    of \code{ftypeOfInterest} and \code{trtOfInterest}.}
  \item{var}{A covariance matrix for the point estimates.}
  \item{meanIC}{The empirical mean of the efficient influence function at
    the estimated, targeted nuisance parameters. Each value should be small
    or the user will be warned that excessive finite-sample bias may exist
    in the point estimates.}
  \item{ic}{The efficient influence function at the estimated, fluctuated
    nuisance parameters, evaluated on each of the observations. These are
    used to construct confidence intervals for post-hoc comparisons.}
  \item{ftimeMod}{If \code{returnModels = TRUE} the fit object(s) for calls
    to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} or \code{\link[stats]{glm}}
    for the outcome regression models. If \code{method="mean"} this will be
    a list of length \code{length(ftypeOfInterest)} each of length \code{t0}
    (one regression for each failure type and for each timepoint). If
    \code{method = "hazard"} this will be a list of length
    \code{length(ftypeOfInterest)} with one fit corresponding to the hazard
    for each cause of failure. If \code{returnModels = FALSE}, this entry
    will be \code{NULL}.}
  \item{ctimeMod}{If \code{returnModels = TRUE} the fit object for the call
    to \code{\link[stats]{glm}} or \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
    for the pooled hazard regression model for the censoring distribution.
    If \code{returnModels = FALSE}, this entry will be \code{NULL}.}
  \item{trtMod}{If \code{returnModels = TRUE} the fit object for the call to
    \code{\link[stats]{glm}} or \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}} for
    the conditional probability of \code{trt} regression model. If
    \code{returnModels = FALSE}, this entry will be \code{NULL}.}
  \item{t0}{The timepoint at which the function was evaluated.}
  \item{ftime}{The \code{numeric} vector of failure times used in the fit.}
  \item{ftype}{The \code{numeric} vector of failure types used in the fit.}
  \item{trt}{The \code{numeric} vector of treatment assignments used in the
    fit.}
  \item{adjustVars}{The \code{data.frame} of failure times used in the fit.}

\description{
This function estimates the marginal cumulative incidence for
 failures of specified types using targeted minimum loss-based estimation
 based on the initial estimates of the cause-specific hazard functions for
 failures of each type. The function is called by \code{\link{survtmle}}
 whenever \code{method = "hazard"} is specified. However, power users could,
 in theory, make calls directly to this function.
