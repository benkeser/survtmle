\arguments{
\item{dataList}{A list of \code{data.frame} objects. See the documentation
of \code{\link{makeDataList}} for more information.}

\item{dat}{A \code{data.frame} in short form. See the documentation of
\code{\link{makeDataList}} for more information.}

\item{allJ}{Numeric vector indicating the labels of all causes of failure.}

\item{ofInterestJ}{Numeric vector indicating \code{ftypeOfInterest} that was
passed to \code{\link{hazard_tmle}}.}

\item{nJ}{The number of unique failure types.}

\item{uniqtrt}{The values of \code{trtOfInterest} passed to
\code{\link{mean_tmle}}.}

\item{t0}{The timepoint at which \code{\link{survtmle}} was called to
evaluate.}

\item{verbose}{A \code{logical} indicating whether the function should print
messages to indicate progress.}

\item{att}{A \code{boolean} indicating whether to compute the ATT estimate,
instead of treatment specific survival curves. This option only works with 
two levels of \code{trt} that are labeled with 0 and 1.}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not currently used.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{data.frame} with columns \code{D.jX.zZ}
 added for each value of X in \code{ofInterestJ} and each value of Z in
 \code{uniqtrt}. These are the sum over all timepoints of the estimated
 efficient influence function evaluated at that observation.
}
\description{
This function computes the hazard-based efficient influence
 curve at the final estimate of the fluctuated cause-specific hazard
 functions and evaluates it on the observed data. The influence function is
 computed on the long-format data but is subsequently summed over all
 timepoints for each observation and the function returns a new short-form
 data set with columns added corresponding to the sum over all timepoints of
 the estimated efficient influence function evaluated at that observation.
