\arguments{
\item{ftime}{An integer-valued vector of failure times. Right-censored
observations should have corresponding \code{ftype} set to 0.}

\item{ftype}{An integer-valued vector indicating the type of failure.
Observations with \code{ftype=0} are treated as being right-censored. Each
unique value besides zero is treated as a separate type of failure.}

\item{trt}{A numeric vector indicating observed treatment assignment. Each
unique value will be treated as a different type of treatment. Currently,
only two unique values are supported.}

\item{adjustVars}{A data.frame of adjustment variables that will be used in
estimating the conditional treatment, censoring, and failure (hazard or
conditional mean) probabilities.}

\item{t0}{The time at which to return cumulative incidence estimates. By
default this is set to \code{max(ftime[ftype > 0])}.}

\item{SL.ftime}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} in the call to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
for the outcome regression (either cause-specific hazards or iterated
mean). See the documentation of \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
for more information on how to specify valid \code{SuperLearner} libraries.
It is expected that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with
the input variables, which will be called \code{"trt"},
\code{names(adjustVars)}, and \code{"t"} (if \code{method="hazard"}).}

\item{SL.ctime}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} in the call to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
for the estimate of the conditional hazard for censoring. It is expected
that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the input
variables, which will be called \code{"trt"} and \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{SL.trt}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} in the call to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
for the estimate of the conditional probability of treatment. It is
expected that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with the
input variables, which will be \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{SL.ftimeMissing}{A character vector or list specification to be passed to the
\code{SL.library} in the call to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
for the missingness model for failure time.
It is expected that the wrappers used in the library will play nicely with
the input variables, which will be called \code{"trt"} and 
\code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ftime}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the outcome regression. Ignored if
\code{SL.ftime} is not equal to \code{NULL}. Use \code{"trt"} to specify
the treatment in this formula (see examples). The formula can additionally
include any variables found in \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ctime}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the estimate of the conditional hazard for
censoring. Ignored if \code{SL.ctime} is not equal to \code{NULL}. Use
\code{"trt"} to specify the treatment in this formula (see examples). The
formula can additionally include any variables found in
\code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.trt}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the estimate of the conditional probability of
treatment. Ignored if \code{SL.trt} is not equal to \code{NULL}. The
formula can include any variables found in \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{glm.ftimeMissing}{A character specification of the right-hand side of the
equation passed to the \code{\link[stats]{formula}} option of a call to
\code{\link[stats]{glm}} for the missingness failure times model. Ignored if
\code{SL.ftimeMissing} is not equal to \code{NULL}. Use \code{"trt"} to specify
the treatment in this formula (see examples). The formula can additionally
include any variables found in \code{names(adjustVars)}.}

\item{returnIC}{A \code{logical} indicating whether to return vectors of
influence curve estimates. These are needed for some post-hoc comparisons,
so it is recommended to leave as \code{TRUE} (the default) unless the user
is sure these estimates will not be needed later.}

\item{returnModels}{A \code{logical} indicating whether to return the
\code{glm} or \code{SuperLearner} objects used to estimate the nuisance
parameters. Must be set to \code{TRUE} if the user plans to use
\code{\link{timepoints}} to obtain estimates of incidence at times other
than \code{t0}. See the documentation of \code{\link{timepoints}} for more
information.}

\item{att}{A \code{boolean} indicating whether to compute the ATT estimate,
instead of treatment specific survival curves. This option only works with 
two levels of \code{trt} that are labeled with 0 and 1.}

\item{ftypeOfInterest}{An input specifying what failure types to compute
estimates of incidence for. The default value computes estimates for values
\code{unique(ftype)}. Can alternatively be set to a vector of values found
in \code{ftype}.}

\item{trtOfInterest}{An input specifying which levels of \code{trt} are of
interest. The default value computes estimates for all of the values in
\code{unique(trt)}. Can alternatively be set to a vector of values found in
\code{trt}.}

\item{cvControl}{A \code{list} providing control options to be fed directly
into calls to \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}. This should match
the contents of \code{SuperLearner.CV.control} exactly. For details,
consult the documentation of the \pkg{SuperLearner} package.}

\item{method}{A character specification of how the targeted minimum
loss-based estimators should be computed, either \code{"mean"} or
\code{"hazard"}. The \code{"mean"} specification uses a closed-form
targeted minimum loss-based estimation based on the G-computation formula
of Bang and Robins (2005). The \code{"hazard"} specification uses an
iterative algorithm based on cause-specific hazard functions. The latter
specification has no guarantee of convergence in finite samples. The
convergence can be influenced by the stopping criteria specified in the
\code{tol}. Future versions may implement a closed-form version of this
hazard-based estimator.}

\item{bounds}{A \code{data.frame} of bounds on the conditional hazard
function (if \code{method = "hazard"}) or on the iterated conditional means
(if \code{method = "mean"}). The \code{data.frame} should have a column
named \code{"t"} that includes values \code{seq_len(t0)}. The other columns
should be names \code{paste0("l",j)} and \code{paste0("u",j)} for each
unique failure type label j, denoting lower and upper bounds, respectively.
See examples.}

\item{verbose}{A \code{logical} indicating whether the function should print
messages to indicate progress. If \code{\link[SuperLearner]{SuperLearner}}
is called internally, this option will be passed to it.}

\item{tol}{The stopping criteria when \code{method="hazard"}. The TMLE
algorithm performs updates to the initial estimators until the empirical
mean of the efficient influence function is smaller than \code{tol} or
until \code{maxIter} iterations have been completed. The default
(\code{1/length(ftime)}) is a sensible value. Larger values can be used in
situations where convergence of the algorithm is an issue; however, this
may result in large finite-sample bias.}

\item{maxIter}{A maximum number of iterations for the algorithm when
\code{method = "hazard"}. The algorithm will iterate until either the
empirical mean of the efficient influence function is smaller than
\code{tol} or until \code{maxIter} iterations have been completed.}

\item{Gcomp}{A \code{logical} indicating whether to compute the
G-computation estimator (i.e., a substitution estimator with no targeting
step). Theory does not support inference for the G-computation estimator if
Super Learner is used to estimate failure and censoring distributions. The
G-computation is only implemented for \code{method = "mean"}.}

\item{gtol}{The truncation level of predicted censoring survival. Setting to
larger values can help performance in data sets with practical positivity
violations.}

\item{returnCall}{A \code{logical} specifying whether to return the function
call via \code{match.call(expand.dots = TRUE)}. Set to \code{FALSE} to have
the \code{call} slot return only \code{NA} when passing in pre-computed
initial estimates to reduce memory inefficiency overhead. Defaults to
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{stratify}{Only available if \code{method = "hazard"}. If \code{TRUE}, then the hazard 
models for both ctime and ftime are estimated using only
the observations with \code{trt == trtOfInterest}. Only works if 
\code{length(trtOfInterest) == 1}. If \code{stratify = TRUE} then \code{glm.ftime}
cannot include \code{trt} in the model formula and any learners in \code{SL.ftime}
should not assume a variable named \code{trt} will be included in the candidate 
super learner estimators.}
